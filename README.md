#README
all of these files are just simple python files im using to increase my experience as a comp eng. student - Some might be really  simple and a five minute project or 
or some might be 3+ hour long projects.
I'm publishing these because I just want anyone to have any BASIC source code for a genuine Python function like a calculator or a small tier recall database, or a countdown
clock, or encryption text generator, anything that you can take the BASE code for and optimize it for people who are way beyond my skill OR just impliment it as is, IDC LOL.
